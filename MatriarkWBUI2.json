          "text1": "👉 Respect the community — don't be an ass. Kindness and consideration are expected at all times.\n\n1) Act like an adult.\nBe mature and respectful in all chats and on Discord. Keep it drama-free; harassment and toxicity aren't tolerated.\n\n2) Keep names appropriate.\nAvoid inappropriate or \"Human\" character names; this applies to all languages. Final call rests with JJ.\n\n3) Play fair.\nLost tames or items from normal gameplay or Wildcard bugs are not replaced.\nMutated or boss-level tames should not be gifted to new players — respect game progression.\n\n4) Keep it constructive.\nReport issues once; repeated complaints or rants clutter the cluster.\n\n5) Build with awareness.\nGive others space and stay clear of public structures.\nBase limits per map:\n- 1 main base\n- 1 outpost / trap / treehouse\n- 1 water pen for raising or storing water tames\n\n6) Manage breeders responsibly.\nDo not leave creatures on breed or wander.\nLimit: 2 snails + 2 dung beetles (neutered).\n\n7) Protect shared areas.\nLeave resources, explorer notes, artifact caves, and public-use areas accessible.\n\n8) Limit offline clutter.\nKeep a max of 30 tames out while offline.\nSet behavior so they don't cause chaos while you're gone.\n\n9) Turret etiquette.\n- Wilds Only\n- Medium or Low range\n- x50 damage\n- ORP active\n\n10) Clean as you go.\nStructure pickup is ON — use it. Keep builds tidy and avoid spam.\n\n11) Cloning chambers.\nMax 1 cloning chamber per tribe, per map.\n\n12) Choose tribe members wisely.\nYou are responsible for your tribe. Ongoing rule-breaking can result in a full tribe wipe and ban.\n\n13) Ocean platforms.\nMax of 4 large squares, or any combination equal to that footprint.",
